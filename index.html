        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p align="justify">Maintaining high standards in disinfection and hygiene in workplaces, learning facilities, and healthcare settings
            is a significant challenge in the new normal. With the continuous evolution of infectious pathogens, there is a
            growing necessity for an efficient, smart, and effective way to disinfect and monitor shared spaces in order to
            protect employees, students, patients, and the community itself from the spread of infectious diseases. One of the
            shared spaces that have the highest susceptibility of bacterial and viral contamination are the surfaces in restroom
            cubicles. Traditional disinfecting methods via human intervention are often inadequate, time-consuming, and
            resource-intensive, making it imperative to find a solution that can address these concerns comprehensively and
            sustainably. This problem calls for a product that can provide automated, real-time disinfection and monitoring
            in a way that is adaptable to different cubicle profiles and aligns with the “new normal” emphasis on safety and
            well-being as well as complying with the advent of renewable, sustainable energy</p>
        <p align="justify">SMART Cleanse is an innovative monitoring and disinfecting device designed to address the heightened hygiene
            and safety requirements in workplaces, learning facilities, and healthcare settings. It offers a comprehensive
            solution that combines automated disinfection with real-time monitoring and reporting, ensuring the cleanliness
            and safety of shared spaces.</p>
        <p align="justify">SMART Cleanse is a versatile, solar-powered, wireless, and scalable device that combines disinfection methods
            with real-time monitoring and SMS notifications. It addresses the critical need for enhanced hygiene and safety
            in various settings, from workplaces and educational institutions to healthcare facilities, aligning with the

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        
        <p align="justify">SMART Cleanse use of solar power for its operation is a highly innovative feature.
            This self-sustaining power source allows it to function independently, reducing its carbon footprint and ensuring
            continuous operation even during power outages. This innovation aligns with sustainable development goals
            (SDGs), particularly SDG 7, which focuses on clean and affordable energy access for all.</p>
        <p align="justify">The device's wireless capabilities and modular design make it adaptable to a
            wide range of environments. The ease with which it can be assembled and installed in various cubicle profiles is
            another innovative aspect that enhances its versatility.</p>
        <p align="justify">SMART Cleanse has an ability to provide real-time monitoring
            and SMS notifications to maintenance crews when disinfection liquid is low. This proactive approach ensures
            that the reservoirs are always filled and repetitive checking action on the maintenance crew is alleviated.</p>
        <p align="justify">The use of dual disinfection methods, including disinfecting liquid misting and
            surface UV light disinfection, is a unique and innovative approach. This combination ensures comprehensive and
            effective sanitation of surfaces, making it more reliable in the fight against pathogens. The innovation supports
            SDG 6, which emphasizes the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation.</p>
        <p align="justify">SMART Cleanse unlimited scalability is a feature that sets it apart. Whether used in a small office
            or a large healthcare facility, the device can adapt to any number of cubicles. This scalability caters to the diverse
            needs of various settings and efficiency as well</p>
        <p align="justify">The real-time display of disinfection progress as a percentage is an original
            feature. It provides visual feedback and reassurance to users that the device is effectively sanitizing surfaces,
            enhancing transparency and trust in the disinfection process.</p>
        <p align="justify">In conclusion, SMART Cleanse disinfection capabilities hold significant social importance by preventing
            infections, promoting health equity, instilling confidence, protecting communities, and reducing the burden on
            healthcare systems. It was also proven that the design of the SMART Cleanse was widely accepted by the
            community. The modularity and simplicity of the installation was ingenious and novel. The interviews conducted
            with users highlight its positive impact on individuals and society as a whole, particularly in the context of
            enhanced hygiene practices during the "new normal."</p>
